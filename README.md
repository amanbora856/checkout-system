Checkout System

This is a simple checkout system that applies pricing rules for discounts based on the number of items purchased. It supports:

A 3-for-2 deal on Apple TVs (buy 3, pay for 2).

A bulk discount on Super iPads (if more than 4 are bought, each costs $499.99 instead of $549.99).

Features

Written in TypeScript.
